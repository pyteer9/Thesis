## Abstract:

No one is safe on the web, cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and companies, especially large companies, are under the eye of cybercriminals.
Moreover, cloud technologies have spread exponentially in the world, thus major concern come in play regarding the cyber security and the privacy of firms and even single persons that use services from cloud providers. The number of cyber-attacks launched are constantly increasing, these are launched on cloud infrastructures, IT structures and even IoT devices; it is not only the number of attacks that increases with the transit of time, but it is also the attack techniques that evolve, new ones born and other change their nature of behavior within the time [1]. In fact, according to what is stated in the Clusit 2022 Report, in 2021, attacks around the world increased by 10% from the previous year, and they are getting more serious. New attack modes show that cyber criminals are increasingly sophisticated and able to network with organized crime. The severity of attacks has been increasing sharply. In fact, in 2021, 79% of detected attacks had a "high" impact, up from 50% last year. The main motivation was cybercrime, accounting for 86% of cyber-attacks, up from 81% in 2020 [12]. These numbers should make us think: people about the vulnerability of their privacy, companies on the vulnerability of their intellectual property and their information assets. Cybercriminals in common parlance are called hackers but the correct term is cracker. In fact, the hacker is the one who uses their skills and knowledge to explore and learn without causing harm to people and companies, while the cracker is the one who acts illegally to cause damage or profit.
This thesis project aims to provide a solution via Deep Learning model to recognize and block eventually cyber-attack of different natures.
